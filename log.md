# log for g34p experiment

## Aug 7 2025
- Removed DIAC species (~12 individuals germinated), and replaced with back-up secies DISP (~50 individuals germinated)
- Shade treatment started for all blocks

## August 6 2025
- Put out 8 par sensors (van Gestel labs)

## August 2 2025
- Greenhouse received an alarm, T-stat was replaced on Aug. 2.

## August 1 2025
- watering, fertilizing, and shuffling: made excel sheet to track these updates
- Thinned out all species, only 1 individual per pot, excluding DIAC. DIAC is still too small to thin
- Species updates:
    - All PABE (A & B) were removed and replaced with backup species PACO (100+ individuals germinated). PABE.A only had 5 individuals germinate, PABE.B only had 24 individuals. 
    - All PAHI.A (17 individuals germinate) were removed and replaced with extra PAHI.B individuals (107 individuals germinate).
        - All "PAHI" tags were removed and updated with correct code "PAHA" (user error)
    - All PAAN.A (154 individuals germinated) were removed and replaced with extra PAAN.B individuals (187 individuals germinated). 
    - All species that were transplanted received an extra 50mL of water


## July 23 2025
- deployed PAR sensors

## July 22 2025
- deployed temperature & RH probes
- all 8 species in pots have initial growth. 
- C4 back-up species showing significant growth
- C3 back-up species showing no growth 

## July 14 2025
- 100 mL of full-strength Hoagland's fertilizer applied to every pot
- Planted 2 back-up species that arrived late. PACO (C4) and DISP (C3)

## July 10 2025
- Planted all seeds
- Added 200 mL of water after planting seeds
- Species updates:
    - PABE, PAHI, and PAAN were split into "A" and "B" since seeds came from 2 different locations
    - Error with naming of "PAHI" should be "PAHA", but printed tags before could noticing

## July 09 2025
-  Prewatered pots with 800 mL water
